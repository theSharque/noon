# You can copy this to one of:
# - "/etc/mysql/my.cnf" to set global options,
# - "~/.my.cnf" to set user-specific options.
# 
# One can use all long options that the program supports.
# Run program with --help to get a list of available options and with
# --print-defaults to see which it would actually understand and use.
#
# For explanations see

# This will be passed to all mysql clients
# It has been reported that passwords should be enclosed with ticks/quotes
# escpecially if they contain "#" chars...
# Remember to edit /etc/mysql/debian.cnf when changing the socket location.

# Prior to MySQL 5.0, user passwords were stored in a rather weak way. This
# has been improved with the drawback that client programs shipped with
# Debian Woody/Sarge (technically: linked against libmysqlclient.so.12 or
# earlier) cannot connect any more if either their account has either been
# created or their password has been modified using MySQL 5.0.
